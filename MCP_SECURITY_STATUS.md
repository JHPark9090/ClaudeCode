# MCP Security Status Report

**Date**: October 22, 2025
**Environment**: `/pscratch/sd/j/junghoon` (Quantum ML Research)

---

## ✅ Security Actions Completed

### 1. Tavily Search - SECURED ✓

**Previous Risk**: API key exposed in plaintext config file
**Action Taken**:
- Removed hardcoded API key from `.claude.json`
- Moved API key to environment variable `TAVILY_API_KEY` in `~/.bashrc`
- Reinstalled Tavily using environment variable reference

**Current Status**: 🟢 **SECURED**
- API key no longer visible in config files
- Uses environment variable: `${TAVILY_API_KEY}`
- Connected and functional

**Remaining Usage Guidelines**:
⚠️ **Use Tavily only for**:
- Generic academic literature searches
- Public documentation lookups
- Non-sensitive background research

❌ **NEVER use Tavily for**:
- Searches containing proprietary algorithm names (HQTCN3, Quixer, etc.)
- Dataset identifiers (ABCD subjects, UK Biobank IDs)
- Internal project codenames
- Specific research questions revealing your methodology

**Why**: All search queries are sent to Tavily's external servers and logged.

---

### 2. Serena MCP Server - REMOVED ✓

**Previous Risk**: Full codebase access to entire research directory
**Action Taken**:
- Completely removed Serena MCP server from configuration
- Deleted persistent index directory (`~/.serena/`)
- No residual codebase information remains

**Current Status**: 🟢 **REMOVED**

**Reasoning for Removal**:
- Serena's core function requires reading entire codebase
- Your `/pscratch/sd/j/junghoon` contains:
  - Unpublished quantum ML research (86+ files)
  - Proprietary algorithms (HQTCN, Quixer transformers)
  - Sensitive dataset paths (ABCD, UK Biobank)
  - Competition work (EEG Challenge)
- Even in read-only mode, intellectual property exposure was unacceptable
- Risk outweighed benefit for research environment

**What You Keep**:
- ✅ Claude Code's native code understanding (Read, Grep, Edit tools)
- ✅ Sequential Thinking for complex reasoning
- ✅ Full control over what context I receive

---

### 3. Sequential Thinking - SAFE & ACTIVE ✓

**Status**: 🟢 **SAFE - RECOMMENDED FOR USE**

**Why It's Safe**:
- Official MCP server (maintained by Model Context Protocol team)
- Stateless operation (no persistent storage)
- Local execution only (no external network calls)
- Open source and auditable
- Thought logging disabled (`DISABLE_THOUGHT_LOGGING=true`)

**What It Does**:
- Enhances problem-solving through structured reasoning
- Allows breaking down complex tasks into steps
- Enables revision and refinement of approaches
- No access to your codebase beyond what you share in conversation

**Current Status**: Connected and ready to use

## 📊 Current MCP Server Inventory

| Server | Status | Risk Level | Purpose |
|--------|--------|-----------|---------|
| **Sequential Thinking** | ✅ Active | 🟢 LOW | Enhanced reasoning |
| **Tavily Search** | ✅ Active (Secured) | 🟡 MODERATE | Web search |
| **Serena** | ❌ Removed | N/A | (Previously: Code analysis) |

---

## 🛡️ Security Configuration Summary

### Environment Variables Set
```bash
# In ~/.bashrc
export TAVILY_API_KEY="tvly-***"  # Secured
export DISABLE_THOUGHT_LOGGING=true  # Privacy
```

### MCP Servers Configuration
- **Location**: `/global/homes/j/junghoon/.claude.json`
- **Scope**: User-level (not committed to research repo)
- **API Keys**: Stored in environment variables (not hardcoded)

### Removed Artifacts
- ✅ Serena MCP server configuration
- ✅ `~/.serena/` index directory
- ✅ Hardcoded Tavily API key

---

## 📋 Security Best Practices Going Forward

### When Using Tavily
1. ✅ Keep queries generic and non-specific
2. ✅ Never include proprietary terminology
3. ✅ Avoid mentioning dataset names or subject IDs
4. ✅ Review search queries before sending

### When Working with Claude Code
1. ✅ Only @-mention files you want me to see
2. ✅ Use Sequential Thinking for complex problem-solving
3. ✅ Don't paste sensitive data (patient info, credentials)
4. ✅ Be cautious about discussing unpublished results

### Regular Security Maintenance
1. 🔄 Review installed MCP servers monthly: `claude mcp list`
2. 🔄 Audit `.claude.json` for exposed credentials
3. 🔄 Rotate API keys every 90 days
4. 🔄 Remove unused MCP servers immediately

## 🚫 MCP Servers to AVOID for Research

Based on comprehensive risk assessment:

| Server | Risk Level | Reason to Avoid |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Mem0** | 🔴 CRITICAL | Persistent storage of all conversations |
| **Playwright** | 🔴 HIGH | Browser control, external network access |
| **Serena** | 🔴 HIGH | Full codebase access and indexing |
| Any server requiring full codebase access | 🔴 CRITICAL | IP exposure risk |
| Any server with cloud storage | 🔴 CRITICAL | Data leaves your control |

## ✅ Security Checklist

- [x] Tavily API key secured in environment variable
- [x] Serena removed from configuration
- [x] Serena index directory deleted
- [x] Sequential Thinking active with logging disabled
- [x] No exposed credentials in config files
- [x] MCP server inventory documented
- [x] Usage guidelines established
- [x] Regular maintenance plan defined

## 🎯 Summary

Your MCP environment is now **secured for quantum ML research work**.

**What Changed**:
1. Tavily API key moved from exposed plaintext → secure environment variable
2. Serena completely removed (IP protection)
3. Only safe, vetted MCP servers remain active

**Current Security Posture**: 🟢 **GOOD**
- No sensitive data exposed in configurations
- No servers with full codebase access
- Minimal external data transmission
- Research intellectual property protected

**You can now safely use**:
- ✅ Claude Code's native capabilities
- ✅ Sequential Thinking for complex reasoning
- ✅ Tavily for generic web searches (with caution)

## 📞 Questions or Concerns?

If you need to:
- Install additional MCP servers → Review risk assessment first
- Share this environment with collaborators → Audit `.claude.json` and `~/.bashrc`
- Work with more sensitive data → Consider disabling all external MCP servers

**When in doubt**: Less is more. Fewer MCP servers = less attack surface.
